### 2025/05/19 ( and the past 3 days I didnt )
This has been mostly just research on *how* I'm actually pulling this off. I've ( tenatively ) setteled on this as a **very rough** list of what I'll use:
- ESP32s3
- Some sort of small TFT display
- microSd reader
- rotary encoder?
- headphone jack
- some buttons ?
- rechargeable battery?
I still need to figure out the best input methods, as well as whether a battery is super important for the design. I think it would be a nice bonus, but not nessicary if the footprint gets too tight.
I also started to gather references for the design, not sure whether to go for the pre or post revamp termial model for inspo. ( these frickers )
