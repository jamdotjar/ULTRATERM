# ULTRATERM
ULTRATERM is a miniature replica of an ULTRAKILL settings terminal ( like the one used in cybergrind ), that acts as a bluetooth audio player.

## Design
The terminal sits at around 125mm tall, with a 57x104mm footprint. It was designed to look cool, be fairly accurate, and act as a (mostly) stand alone device. It features:
- 2.4" TFT display
- Touchscreen + 3 physical buttons
- A 2000mAh battery
- Bluetooth headphone support
- USB-C storage interface
- Removable SD card storage ( and a custom microSD card adapter )
The case is designed to be entirely 3D printable, and assembled without adhesive or fasteners.
